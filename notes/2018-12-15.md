# Dec 15 2018 -- Live on Stream

Started poking around to see the exact pipeline for how the T2 runs code.

Main question: how and using what code does the T2 translate Node.JS commands into SPI bus signals? t2-firmware/node/tessel-export.js.

## T2-cli

* Runs commands on the Linux subsystem
* (Possibly) handles the Mediatek side of bridge comms w/SAMD21

## openwrt-tessel

* Runs a modified openWRT on the Tessel 2's mediatek chip

## T2-firmware

* the SAMD21 (Cortex M0) firmware
* Includes the SPI bridge with the mediatek chip (running openwrt-tessel)
* Also includes the Node.JS native modules that communicate w/SAMD21
  * t2-firmware/blob/master/node/tessel-export.js
    * Line 310: Mentions connecting to an 'SPI daemon' -- see soc/
  * common/board.h -- sets up the SAMD21 side of the board.
* https://github.com/tessel/t2-firmware#bridge -- info on SPI bridge
* https://github.com/tessel/t2-firmware/tree/master/soc -- this is the SPI doemon!

## General plan of attack:

* Get a C library that runs WS2812 leds running in the t2-firmware on the SAMD21
* Create a set of signals that will initalize LED strips, change colors, etc
  * Design the WS2812 API for the node side as well as the SPI bus side
* Connect the node API to the SPI bus commands
* Connect the C code to the SPI bus commands
* Write unit tests
* Celebrate!

## Possible WS2812 Libraries

* https://www.pjrc.com/non-blocking-ws2812-led-library/
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel_ZeroDMA
  * Requires Neopixel library...lots of deps, may require rewrite.
* https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED
  * Supports more than WS2812
  * C++...but we can probably workaround 
  * http://fastled.io/docs/3.1/md__p_o_r_t_i_n_g.html

## Summary

* Figured out how the T2 bridges Node.JS with the SPI bridge between the Mediatek SoC and the SAMD21 co-processor
* Picked FastLED as a reasonable lib to port for LED use on Tessel 2
* Forked FastLED to get started on getting it on the T2

## Getting started with FastLED

* Need to remove other platforms for our fork
* Rename fork to FastLED-Tessel

* command to compile for SAMD21: arm-none-eabi-gcc FastLED.cpp
